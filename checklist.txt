Hospital Sample Carrier ROS Package Checklist
---------------------------------------------

[ ] 1. URDF/XACRO File
    - File: urdf/hospital_sample_carrier.urdf
    - Robot base link defined with proper visual, collision, and inertial properties
    - Four wheels (front/back, left/right) and corresponding continuous joints
    - Sliding drawer compartment:
        [ ] compartment_base and compartment_drawer links
        [ ] prismatic joint 'joint_drawer_slide' with limits set
    - Three sample slots (slot_1, slot_2, slot_3) visually attached to drawer
    - RFID sensor mount and frame
    - Status display panel link and joint
    - Optional TF root (map link) defined
    - All joints have proper parent-child links and axis/origin defined

[ ] 2. Launch File
    - File: launch/hospital_sample_carrier.launch
    - Loads URDF into ROS parameter server
    - robot_state_publisher node included
    - joint_state_publisher_gui node included for manual drawer control
    - RViz node launched with custom RViz config
    - Parameters: publish_frequency, use_tf_static

[ ] 3. RViz Configuration

    - Displays: RobotModel, TF, Grid
    - RobotModel:
        [ ] Robot Description: robot_description
        [ ] Visual enabled, Collision disabled
        [ ] Alpha set correctly
    - Fixed Frame: map
    - Camera/View settings configured

[ ] 4. CMake Configuration
    - File: CMakeLists.txt
    - Minimum CMake version set
    - Project name matches package
    - Required dependencies included: roscpp, rospy, std_msgs, urdf, xacro, robot_state_publisher, joint_state_publisher(_gui), rviz
    - catkin_package() invoked
    - include_directories() uses ${catkin_INCLUDE_DIRS}
    - Install directories for launch, urdf, and rviz provided

[ ] 5. Package Manifest
    - File: package.xml
    - Name, version, description, maintainer, and license set
